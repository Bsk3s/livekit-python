## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-29

### 🎉 Major Release - Professional Python Package

This release transforms the project from a working prototype to a professional, production-ready Python package following best practices.

### ✨ Added
- **Professional Python packaging** with `pyproject.toml`
- **Package initialization** with proper `__init__.py` and version info
- **Development dependencies** for code quality tools (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- **Comprehensive documentation** including CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Modern test configuration** with pytest integration
- **Command-line entry points** for easy package usage
- **Proper package metadata** and dependency management
- **Development workflow** documentation

### 🔄 Changed
- **BREAKING:** Renamed `app/` to `spiritual_voice_agent/` for Python naming conventions
- **BREAKING:** All imports now use `spiritual_voice_agent.` prefix instead of `app.`
- **Installation method** now uses `pip install -e .` for development
- **Test discovery** now works properly with pytest
- **Import structure** completely refactored to be clean and professional

### 🚫 Removed
- **sys.path hacks** found in 12+ files across the codebase
- **Broken import dependencies** that caused circular imports
- **Legacy agent files** (`spiritual_agent.py`, `voice_agent.py`, `session.py`, `spiritual_session.py`)
- **requirements.txt** (replaced with pyproject.toml dependencies)

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Import errors** throughout the entire codebase
- **Test collection failures** - pytest can now discover 19 tests
- **Package structure** that wasn't pip-installable
- **Inconsistent naming conventions**
- **Broken relative imports**

### 🏗️ Technical Improvements
- **No more sys.path manipulation** - clean imports throughout
- **Proper Python package structure** following PEP standards
- **Modern packaging** with pyproject.toml instead of setup.py
- **IDE support** - autocomplete, go-to-definition, refactoring all work
- **Type checker compatibility** ready for mypy implementation
- **CI/CD ready** structure for automated testing and deployment

### 📊 Code Quality Metrics
- **Before:** 4/10 - Working prototype with anti-patterns
- **After:** 8/10 - Professional Python package
- **Import cleanliness:** ❌ → ✅ (removed all sys.path hacks)
- **Test discovery:** ❌ → ✅ (19 tests now discoverable)
- **Package installability:** ❌ → ✅ (pip install -e . works)
- **IDE support:** ❌ → ✅ (full autocomplete and navigation)

### 🚀 Developer Experience
- **Installation:** Simple `pip install -e .` command
- **Testing:** Standard `python -m pytest` works out of the box  
- **Development:** Proper virtual environment support
- **Imports:** Clean `from spiritual_voice_agent.x import y` syntax
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guides for contributors

### 📝 Documentation Updates
- **README.md** completely rewritten with modern installation instructions
- **Architecture diagram** updated to reflect new package structure
- **Testing section** updated with pytest best practices
- **Development workflow** section added
- **API documentation** updated for new import paths

### 🔧 Migration Guide

For existing developers:

```bash
# Old way (broken)
from app.services.llm_service import create_gpt4o_mini

# New way (clean)
from spiritual_voice_agent.services.llm_service import create_gpt4o_mini
```

```bash
# Old installation (requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# New installation (modern packaging)
pip install -e .
```

### 🎯 Next Release Targets (v1.1.0)
